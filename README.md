## 🧠 How It Works (User Journey)  

1. **Ask or Upload** – Users start by typing a question or uploading documents.  
2. **Plan** – Cogyto,Creates a step-by-step reasoning plan to solve the query.  
3. **Execute** – The system calls the right tools (vector search, knowledge graph, web search, vision analysis, etc.) to gather information.  
4. **Reflect & Refine** – Reviews the draft answer, checks accuracy, and improves clarity before finalizing.  
5. **Deliver** – The user instantly receives a refined, contextual response enriched with insights.
